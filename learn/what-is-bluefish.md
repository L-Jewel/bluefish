# What is Bluefish?

Bluefish is a diagramming framework for the web. In contrast to previous frameworks, which focus on
low-level or high-level abstractions, Bluefish draws inspiration from UI component frameworks like React that
let users define and use their own, custom abstractions (i.e. components).

Bluefish relaxes the component model to *relations*. Unlike components, relations can share children
and they don't need to fully specify their childrens' layouts.

Bluefish is based on work from the [MIT Visualization Group](https://vis.csail.mit.edu/). You can
read more about the theory, design, and implementation of Bluefish in our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00146).
